> **üì¢ Important: Native Azure Functions Support Now Available**
> 
> Azure Functions now offers **native integration** with Azure Container Apps (see [announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-native-azure-functions-support-in-azure-container-apps/4414039)). This is the **recommended hosting method** for most new workloads, combining the full capabilities of Azure Container Apps with the simplicity of the Functions programming model and auto-scaling.

## Overview

> **Note:** Always refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/functions-overview) for the latest information.

Azure Functions on Container Apps enables you to build **event-driven, cloud-native applications** with unprecedented flexibility. Run your functions alongside other microservices, APIs, websites, workflows, or any containerized program‚Äîall within a unified platform.

### Why Choose Azure Functions on Container Apps?

- **Leverage the Functions programming model** with your preferred language or framework
- **Zero infrastructure management** - Built on Azure Kubernetes Service with Dapr and KEDA
- **Unified platform** for all your microservices with consistent networking, observability, and scaling
- **Seamless tooling** across Azure Portal, Azure CLI, and CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)

## Key Capabilities

### üöÄ Polyglot Application Management
Easily integrate mixed workloads in a single environment:
- Azure Functions
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Spring Apps
- APIs, websites, and custom containers
- Unified networking, observability, and configuration across all services

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Native Features
Built-in integration with enterprise-grade technologies:
- **KEDA** for event-driven autoscaling
- **Dapr** for distributed application runtime
- **Envoy** for advanced networking
- Service discovery and native container support

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer-Friendly Experience
- Consistent development experience across all Azure Functions hosting options
- Simplified client tooling and DevOps integration
- Inner loop and outer loop development support
- Runtime flexibility with full Functions programming model

### üìä Dynamic Scaling
- Scale to zero during idle periods
- Scale to dozens of containers under high load
- Event-based scaling with platform-managed triggers

## Common Use Cases

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Event Processing** | React to events from HTTP, Kafka, Event Hubs, Service Bus, or Storage Queues and invoke other services |
| **Web Services & APIs** | REST API backends with event-based execution and authentication workflows |
| **Data Ingestion** | Event-based data quality checks for e-commerce, retail, and travel applications with ML workflow integration |
| **Mixed Microservices** | Seamlessly integrate different application types in a single environment |
| **IoT & Edge Computing** | Process events from IoT devices, point-of-sale systems, and edge locations |

## Supported Triggers and Bindings

The following triggers support platform-managed scaling:

‚úÖ **Fully Supported:**
- HTTP
- Timer
- Azure Event Grid
- Azure Event Hubs
- Azure Blob Storage (event-based)
- Azure Queue Storage
- Azure Service Bus
- Kafka
- Durable Functions (MSSQL storage provider)


### Current Limitations

#### Kafka Triggers
- SSL protocol not supported on Container Apps
- For Event Hubs connections, `username` must resolve to an application setting for dynamic scaling

#### Managed Identities
Supported for:
- Azure Container Registry deployments
- Azure Event Hubs, Queue Storage, and Service Bus triggers/bindings
- Required host storage connections

Not yet supported for:
- Durable Functions MSSQL storage provider (coming soon)

#### Other Considerations
- No direct Kubernetes API access
- Cannot move deployments between resource groups or subscriptions
- Azure CLI `containerapp` extension conflicts with `appservice-kube` extension
- Azure Blob Storage and Event Grid don't require Managed Identity configuration

## Regional Availability

Azure Functions on Container Apps is available in all [Container Apps supported regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=container-apps).
