## Azure Functions on Container App v1 vs v2 Hosting options

| Version | Type | Description | Recommendation | Additional Information |
|---------|------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **V2** | `kind=functionapp` | Native integration with full Container Apps features.<br>‚Ä¢ Direct Container Apps resource creation<br>‚Ä¢ Full access to all Container Apps capabilities<br>‚Ä¢ No separate Azure Functions resource needed | ‚úÖ **Recommended for new workloads** | [Learn more about V2](./v2-functions-on-containerapps-kind=functionapp/README.md) |
| **V1** | Legacy | Original hosting model.<br>‚Ä¢ Creates Azure Functions resource<br>‚Ä¢ Provisions Container Apps resources in read-only platform-managed resource group<br>‚Ä¢ Limited Container Apps feature access | ‚ö†Ô∏è Supported but not recommended for new projects | [Learn more about V1](./v1-functions-on-containerapps-legacy/README.md) |

### Key Differences

- **V2 (Native Integration)**: You create Container Apps directly with `kind=functionapp`, providing full control and access to all Container Apps features without requiring a separate Azure Functions resource.
- **V1 (Legacy)**: Creates an Azure Functions resource that additionally provisions Container Apps resources under a read-only, platform-managed resource group with limited feature access.
