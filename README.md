## Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45637559/229790891-e36169d8-1cd3-497b-85e2-982874ef6584.png)

Azure functions on container apps  helps developers to quickly build event driven, cloud native apps, with the flexibility to run functions along with other microservices, APIs, websites,  workflows or any container hosted programs. You can leverage functions programming model and write code using your preferred programming language or framework that Azure functions supports . You will also get the triggers, bindings and get that first class event driven, cloud native experience. Azure Functions is running on the platform service powered by Azure Container Apps  to run microservices in containers without managing infrastructure. Container Apps Environment is built on a foundation of powerful open-source technology. Behind the scenes, every container app runs on Azure Kubernetes Service, enables to build microservices with full support for Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) and scale dynamically based on HTTP traffic or events powered by Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA). 

Azure Functions on Container Apps Environment offers Azure client tools  and DevOps tooling to provide  seamless experience. This means simplified client tooling features will be enabled with Portal/AzCLI/CICD tools - Azure Pipelines/GitHub Actions. Network and observability configurations  are mapped at Container App Environment so users define these settings at container app environment level which applies to all microservices , functions running as container apps.
-  **Polyglot App Management** : The environment enables to easily integrate mixed workloads - polyglot and heterogeneous modern apps or microservices consisting of webapps hosted on Azure Container Apps, Azure Spring apps, APIs, websites or any container hosted programs along side with Functions besides  providing unified networking, observability, dynamic scaling, configuration, and high productivity
-  **Enable cloud-native capabilities** such as service discovery, native container support, and integration with open source libraries and frameworks like KEDA, Dapr, Envoy
-  **Simplified and seamless client and Devops tooling experiences**  across Azure Portal, Az CLI, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions
-  **Dedicated Networking, Observability and pricing plans** tied to Container App environment as opposed to a single app types


## Scenarios
Here are usecases and  scenarios that can be deployed on to Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps

-  React to events from Http/Kafka/Event hubs/Service Bus/Storage Queue and invoke another web or spring based API running in the Container App environment.               Scale on-demand as the events increase
-  Web Services â€“ Rest APIs backend with event based execution requirements or Authentication APIs which trigger during login or authorization events
-  Event based data ingestion platform to perform  data quality checks for online retail/e-commerce/travel apps. This process helps validating  data for data accuracy, data completeness etc. ML workflows get invoked once data quality processing completes
-  Mixed workloads across different app types. Easy integration across other application types like Azure Container Apps and Azure Spring Apps
-  IoT/Point-Of-Sales/Edge event processing microservices applications

## Key Features of Azure Functions on Container App Environment

Functions on Container App environment is designed to meet the needs of cloud-native requirements, while preserving approachability for teams of all sizes and capabilities. It provides unified platform with portability, flexibility, and  developer-centric entry points for building apps
-  **Integrated Azure Functions Programming model** and write code using your preferred programming language or framework that Azure functions supports 
-  **Consistent end to end development experiences** across Azure functions plans and hosting options using inner loop, outer loop, runtime and DevOps tooling
-  **Build multi type apps** and easily integrate with multiple app types for a microservices design like run functions along with other microservices, APIs, websites,  workflows or any container hosted programs
-  **Scale dynamically based on events** all the way to zero or scale to dozens of containers when under high load

## Triggers and Bindings that would have platform managed scaling enabled so far

-  Http 
-  Azure Storage Queue
-  Azure Service Bus
-  Azure EventHub
-  Kafka Trigger
-  Timer Trigger

## Azure Regions 

Container Apps support for Functions  is  available on all Azure Container Apps supported regions. See the list of supported regions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=container-apps)


When your container is hosted in a [Consumption + Dedicated plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/plans#consumption-dedicated) structure, both Consumption and Dedicated plan are currently supported. For more information on Container apps pricing, see the [Azure Container Apps pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/). For list of supported regions in this plan [see here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/workload-profiles-overview#supported-regions)

used

**Prerequisite check**

Verify your prerequisites, which depend on whether you\'re using Azure CLI for creating Azure resources:
**Azure CLI**
-  In a terminal or command window, run func --version to check that the Azure Functions Core Tools are version 4.x.
-  Run dotnet --list-sdks to check that the required versions are installed.
-  Run az --version to check that the Azure CLI version is 2.4 or later
-  Run az login to sign in to Azure and verify an active subscription.
-  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) is installed, have a [Docker ID](https://hub.docker.com/signup) and Docker is started

## **Create the local function project C# isolated - Http Trigger**


1\. Run theÂ func initÂ command, as follows, to create a functions project in a folder namedÂ *LocalFunctionProj*Â with the specified runtime:
Below sample built for .NET 7

```sh
func init LocalFunctionProj --worker-runtime dotnet-isolated --docker --target-framework net7.0
```

TheÂ \--dockerÂ option generates aÂ DockerfileÂ for the project, which defines a suitable custom container for use with Azure Functions and the selected runtime.

2\. Navigate into the project folder

```sh
cd LocalFunctionProj
```
This folder contains theÂ DockerfileÂ and other files for the project, including configurations files namedÂ [local.settings.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)Â andÂ [host.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-host-json).
By default, theÂ *local.settings.json*Â file is excluded from source control in theÂ *.gitignore*Â file. This exclusion is because the file can contain secrets that are downloaded from Azure.

3\. Open the Dockerfile to include following (Usually found in Line 13)

> FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated:4-dotnet-isolated7.0

> This version of the base image supports Azure Functions deployment to an Azure Container Apps service check to include below as well in the Dockerfile (found in Line 1)
> FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS installer-env 

Sample Dockerfile for .NET 7
```sh
FROM  mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS installer-env

COPY . /src/dotnet-function-app
RUN cd /src/dotnet-function-app && \
  mkdir -p /home/site/wwwroot && \
  dotnet publish *.csproj --output /home/site/wwwroot

# To enable ssh & remote debugging on app service change the base image to the one below
# FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated:3.0-dotnet-isolated5.0-appservice
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated:4-dotnet-isolated7.0
ENV AzureWebJobsScriptRoot=/home/site/wwwroot \
    AzureFunctionsJobHost__Logging__Console__IsEnabled=true

COPY --from=installer-env ["/home/site/wwwroot", "/home/site/wwwroot"]
```
> Note : If you are using .NET 7 then remember to update the .csproj file <TargetFramework> to point to net7.0 as shown below
  ```sh
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
   ```
    
    
4\. Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the --nameÂ argument is the unique name of your function (HttpExample) and the                    Â --templateÂ argument specifies the function\'s trigger (HTTP).

```sh
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger" --authlevel "anonymous"
```

## Build the container image and Test locally

The Dockerfile in the project root describes the minimum required environment to run the function app in a container. The complete list of supported base images for Azure Functions is documented above as **Host images** in the pre-requisites section or can be found in the [Azure Functions Base by Microsoft \| Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-functions-base)

> **Build and Push using Docker:**

1\. In the root project folder, run theÂ [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)Â command, and provide a name,Â azurefunctionsimage, and tag,Â v1.0.0.
> Note: Please make sure docker is running in your local
The following command builds the Docker image for the container.
```sh
docker build --platform linux --tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 .
```

In this example, replaceÂ \<DOCKER_ID\>Â with your Docker Hub account ID. When the command completes, you can run the new container locally.

2\. To test the build, run the image in a local container using theÂ [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)Â command, with the adding the ports argument,Â -p 8080:80.
```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 -it <docker_id>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0
```
Again, replaceÂ <DOCKER_IDÂ with your Docker ID and adding the ports argument,Â -p 8080:80

3\. After the image is running in a local container, browse toÂ http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample?name=Functions, which should display the same "hello" message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function uses anonymous authorization, you can still call the function even though it\'s running in the container. Function access key settings are enforced when running locally in a container. If you have problems calling the function, make sure thatÂ [access to the function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys)Â is set to anonymous.

4\. After you've verified the function app in the container, stop docker withÂ **Ctrl**+**C**.

Docker Hub is a container registry that hosts images and provides image and container services. To share your image, which includes deploying to Azure, you must push it to a registry.
**Docker login**

5\.  If you haven\'t already signed in to Docker, do so with theÂ [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)Â command, replacingÂ  <docker_id>Â with your Docker ID. This command prompts you for your username and password. A "Login Succeeded" message confirms that you\'re signed in.

6\. After you\'ve signed in, push the image to Docker Hub by using theÂ [docker push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/)Â command, again replacingÂ <docker_id>Â with your Docker ID.
```sh
docker push <docker_id>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0
```
 7\. Depending on your network speed, pushing the image the first time might take a few minutes (pushing subsequent changes is much faster). While you\'re waiting, you can proceed to the next section and create Azure resources in another terminal.

> **Build and Push using ACR (Optional Azure Container Registry)**

You can build and deploy functions on Azure container apps using ACR as well. Please make sure you have an [ACR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal?tabs=azure-cli) repository created by following the steps mentioned in the link. Azure Container Registry is a private registry service for building, storing,and managing container images and related artifacts.

1\. Login to the registry

Before pushing and pulling container images, you must log in to the registry. To do so, use theÂ [az acr login](https://learn.microsoft.com/enus/cli/azure/acr#az_acr_login)Â command. Specify only the registry resource name when logging in with the Azure CLI. Don\'t use the fully qualified login server name.

```sh
az acr login --name <registry-name>
```

2\. Build and Push to the registry

Before you can push an image to your registry, you must tag it with the fully qualified name of your registry login server. The login server name is in the formatÂ *\<registry-name\>.azurecr.io*Â (must be all lowercase), for example,Â *mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io*.
Tag the image using theÂ [docker tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/)Â command.
ReplaceÂ <login-server>Â with the login server name of your ACR instance.

```sh
  docker tag <docker_id>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 <login-server>/azurefunctionsimage:v1
  ```

The following command builds the image, and pushes it to your container registry if the build is successful.

```sh
  az acr build --registry $ACR_NAME --image azurefunctionsimage:v1 .
```

## Create Azure resources

Before you can deploy your container to your Azure Container apps you need to create two more resources

a\. AÂ [Storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).Â 

b\. Create the Container Apps environment with a Log Analytics workspace

1\. Login to your Azure subscription

```sh 
az login
  
az account set -subscription | -s <subscription_name>

az upgrade

az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade

az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Web

az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App

az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
```
---

2\. Create azure container app environment

# Workload Profiles in Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps

A workload profile determines the amount of compute and memory resources available to the container apps deployed in an environment. Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps now supports workload profiles. Profiles are configured to fit the different needs of your applications.

The Consumption workload profile is the default profile added to every Workload profiles environment type. You can add Dedicated workload profiles to your environment as you create an environment or after it's created. Read more about workload profile types supported [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/workload-profiles-overview](#).

```sh
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location northeurope
```

## Consumption

Run serverless apps with support for scale-to-zero and pay only for resources your apps use with the consumption profile.

Use the following commands to create a workload profiles environment:

1. **Create workload profiles environment**

```bash

az containerapp env create \
  --enable-workload-profiles \
  --resource-group "<RESOURCE_GROUP>" \
  --name "<NAME>" \
  --location "<LOCATION>"
```
This command can take up to 10 minutes to complete.

Check the status of your environment. The following command reports if the environment is created successfully.

```sh
az containerapp env show \
  --name "<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>" \
  --resource-group "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
```
The provisioningState needs to report Succeeded before moving on to the next command.

Create an environment with an auto-generated Log Analytics workspace.

## Dedicated/GPUs

You can also run apps with customized hardware and increased cost predictability using dedicated workload profiles. The Dedicated plan has a fixed cost for the entire environment regardless of how many workload profiles you're using.

If you want to create an app in a Dedicated profile, you first need to add the profile to the environment.

**Add a new workload profile to an existing environment.**

```sh
az containerapp env workload-profile add --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
 --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --workload-profile-type <WORKLOAD_PROFILE_TYPE> \
--workload-profile-name <WORKLOAD_PROFILE_NAME> \
--min-nodes <MIN_NODES> --max-nodes <MAX_NODES>
```

The value you select for the <WORKLOAD_PROFILE_NAME> placeholder is the workload profile friendly name.
Using friendly names allow you to add multiple profiles of the same type to an environment. The friendly name is what you use as you deploy and maintain a container app in a workload profile.

For more details on edit/delete of profiles refer (here)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/workload-profiles-manage-cli?tabs=external-env&pivots=aca-vnet-managed#add-profiles]

---

3\.  Create Storage account

Use theÂ [az storage account create](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create)Â command to create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region:

```sh
az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location northeurope --resource-group MyResourceGroup --sku Standard_LRS
  ```
ReplaceÂ <STORAGE_NAME>Â with a name that is appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Names must contain three to 24 characters numbers and lowercase letters only.Â Standard_LRSÂ specifies a general-purpose account, which isÂ [supported by Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/storage considerations#storage-account-requirements). TheÂ --locationÂ value is a standard Azure region.

## Create the function app
 
 Run theÂ [az functionapp create](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create)Â command to create a new function app in the new managed environment backed by azure container apps.
 

> Note: **If you wish to use the quick start demo Http trigger sample you can include the below image url for --image parameter(this is a
publicly accessible image so username/password is not required) 
---
```sh  
mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/dotnet8-quickstart-demo:1.0
  ```
---
    
> OR you may keep the image url ready for an existing image that you have in your repo which is already "build" 
    for eg: <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag> ->  mydockerusr/azurefunctionsimage:v2
    
> Using Docker Hub
  ---
```sh
az functionapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name <functionapp_name> \
--environment MyContainerappEnvironment \
--storage-account <Storage_name> \
--functions-version 4 \
--runtime dotnet-isolated \
--image <DOCKER_ID>/<image_name>:<version>
--workload-profile-name  <WORKLOAD_PROFILE_NAME> \
 --cpu <vcpus> \
 --memory <memory>

```

> Using ACR
---    
```sh
az functionapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name <functionapp_name> \
--environment MyContainerappEnvironment \
--storage-account <Storage_name> \
--functions-version 4 \
--runtime dotnet-isolated \
--image <acr login-server>/<image_name>:<version> \
--registry-username <user_name> --registry-password <user_password>
--workload-profile-name  <WORKLOAD_PROFILE_NAME> \
 --cpu <vcpus> \
 --memory <memory>

  ```
 ---

 If you intent to use consumption configure --workload-profile-name  "Consumption" else provide the dedicated workload profile name
Note: For consumption  
```sh
CPU supported range =min  0.5 vCPUs to 4 VCPUs max
Memory = min 1Gi to 8Gi max
default [1 2Gi] 
```
For Dedicated/GPU
```sh
CPU supported range =min  0.5 vCPUs to dedicated profile type max vCPUs limit
Memory = min 1Gi to dedicated profile type max memory limit
default [1 2Gi] 
```

In this example, replaceÂ **MyContainerappEnvironment** with the Azure container apps environment name. Also, replaceÂ <STORAGE_NAME>Â with the name of the account you used in the previous step,Â <APP_NAME>Â with a globally unique name appropriate to you, andÂ <DOCKER_ID> or <login-server>Â with your Docker Hub ID or ACR , <user_name> with the username to log in to container registry(mostly applicable for ACR) and <user_password> with the password to log in to container registry. If
stored as a secret, value must start with 'secretref:' followed by the secret name (mostly applicable for ACR).

TheÂ *--image*Â parameter specifies the image to use for the function app. You can use theÂ [az functionapp config container show](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config/container#az-functionapp-config-container-show)Â command to view information about the image used for deployment. You can also use theÂ [az functionapp config container set](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config/container#az-functionapp-config-container-set)Â command to deploy from a different image.

When you first create the function app, it pulls the initial image from your Docker Hub. You can alsoÂ [Enable continuous deployment to Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-linux-custom-image#enable-continuous-deployment-to-azure)Â from Docker Hub.

**Set required app settings**

Run the following commands to create an app setting for the storage account connection string:
```sh
az storage account show-connection-string --resource-group <Resource_group> --name <STORAGE_NAME> --query connectionString --output tsv
 ```
Copy the output of the above and replace below at <storageConnectionString>
    
```sh
az functionapp config appsettings set --name <app_name> --resource-group <Resource_group> --settings AzureWebJobsStorage="<storageConnectionString>"
```

## Invoke the function on Azure

Because your function uses an HTTP trigger, you invoke it by making an HTTP request to its URL in the browser or with a tool like curl.
Execute below command to get the Invoke URL
    
```sh
az functionapp function show -g <Resource_group> -n  <function_app_name>  --function-name <http_funtion_name> --query "invokeUrlTemplate" --output tsv
```
  
Copy the completeÂ **Invoke URL**Â shown in the output of the publish command into a browser address bar, appending the query parameter ?name=functions or copy the Application Url and append /api/HttpExample?name=HelloWorld. The browser should display similar output as when you ran the function locally.

## Update function container image

If you wish to make changes to your code, modify the image with new version tag and build it, and then finally update the function's container app image please use below command. 
Note: Below sample for docker hub based image

```sh
az functionapp config container set --image <acr login-server>/<image_name>:<version> --registry-password <Password>  --registry-username <DockerUserId> --name <MyFunctionApp> --resource-group <MyResourceGroup>
```
Note: --image should be in the format "<registry-login-server>/<image_name>:<version>"

If you wish you update with a new workload profile type then use the below command.

```sh
az functionapp config container set --name <MyFunctionApp> \
--resource-group <MyResourceGroup> \
--workload-profile-name <workload profile name> \
--cpu <> \
--memory <>
```

If you need to set min replicas to avoid cold start problems then update your functions container app configuration

```sh
az functionapp config container set --name <MyFunctionApp> \
--resource-group <MyResourceGroup> \
--min-replicas <> \
--max-replicas <>
```
## Managed resource groups

Azure Function on Container Apps run your functionized container resources in specially managed resource groups, which helps protect the consistency of your apps by preventing unintended or unauthorized modification or deletion of resources in the managed group by users, groups, or service principles. This managed resource group is created for you the first time you create function app resources in a Container Apps environment. The underlying Azure container apps resource required by your containerized function app run in this managed resource group, and any other function apps that are created in the same environment use this existing group. A managed resource group gets removed automatically after all function app container resources are removed from the environment. While the managed resource group is visible, any attempts to modify or remove the managed resource group result in an error. To remove a managed resource group from an environment, remove all of the function app container resources and it gets removed for you. 

## Managed Identity
Managed Identity is now supported for Azure Functions on Azure Container apps!  A managed identity from Microsoft Entra ID allows your functions app to easily access other Microsoft Entra protected resources such as Azure Key Vault. The identity is managed by the Azure platform and does not require you to provision or rotate any secrets. Support for both system and user-assigned managed identity is enabled. Managed Identities can be used for triggers & bindings, storage account, pull images from Azure Container Registry ACR or fetch secrets from Azure Key Vault. For more about managed identities in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). Check out Managed Identity [samples here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-on-container-apps/tree/main/samples/Biceptemplates/MI_VNET_sample).

## Clean up resources

If you\'re not going to continue on to the next sample function app, you can remove the Azure resources created during this quickstart with the following command.

**Â Caution**

The following command deletes the specified resource group and all resources contained within it. If the group contains resources outside the scope of this quickstart, they are also deleted.

```sh
 az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
 ```
