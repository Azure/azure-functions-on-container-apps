## Overview
> **ðŸ“¢ Important: Native Azure Functions Support Now Available**
> 
> Azure Functions now offers **native integration** with Azure Container Apps (see [announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-native-azure-functions-support-in-azure-container-apps/4414039)). This is the **recommended hosting method** for most new workloads, combining the full capabilities of Azure Container Apps with the simplicity of the Functions programming model and auto-scaling.

### Managed Resource Groups

Azure Functions on Container Apps uses **managed resource groups** to run your containerized function app resources. These specially managed groups:

- **Auto-created**: Generated automatically when you first create function app resources in a Container Apps environment
- **Shared**: Reused by all function apps in the same environment
- **Protected**: Prevent unauthorized modification or deletion of resources, even by service principals
- **Auto-removed**: Deleted automatically when all function app container resources are removed from the environment

**Important**: 
- Managed resource groups are visible but cannot be directly modified or deleted
- Any modification attempts will result in an error
- To remove a managed resource group, remove all function app container resources from the environment
- For issues with managed resource groups, contact support
